## Project Description:
In Lesson 3 assignment we created a new Cloud9 workspace, in which a Bookstrap template was used to defined five key concepts.  Also GitHub account was created and linked to the Cloud9 account, in which a remote repository was created in order to move files from local and remote repositories.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A new concept learned in this lesson was about the *Version Control System*, the types of VCS, and the advantages and disadvatages of each type. Also learned how the Distributed Version Control System will be a great tool in the website design and development, as a way to collaborate with other team members without interruption, and as an individual as a great backup tool to avoid loosing work and production time.
2. Another concept learned in this assignment was about *Git* and its commands, and how even when looking scary because of the black old fashioned way looking screen, the commands are not hard and are a great way to keep a sync of all the changes made to a file, through the main 3 stages.
3. *GitHub* was also a great lesson, specially how it could be sync and linked with Cloud9 to make easier the data management. Knowing that is a free open source, and also a way that many developers collaborate with each other for public websites, I think a great way to improve our web design skills.
