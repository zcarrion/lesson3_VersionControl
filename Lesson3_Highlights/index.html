            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control, also known as revision control or source control is a management software tool to manage changes to documents, programs, and collection of information.  In a Version Control System (VCS) one repository is created for all the project files, and team members can check the files, make changes, and save them, simultaneously.  With the Version Control System files cannot be overwritten, there is one common repository that holds all the latest changed files, allowing to revert back to an older version, if necessary.  This system also provides a benefit for an individual as a backup for a project.  This is a great benefit for web designers, since it is possible to revert an entire project to a previous state, and also comparing and viewing the changes made in the files. There are different types of version control systems:  Local Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control Systems and Distributed Version Control Systems. In the local version control system, there is a simple database in a local computer that kept all the changes to files in the VCS. In the Centralized Version Control System it has a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of users that check out files from that central area, but with the disadvantage of a single point of failure that the centralized represents, specially, if the server goes down. And the Distributed Version Control Systems in which an online server fully mirror the repository, including the full history, and any user in a team can copy back and forward simultaneously within the same project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Is a type of Version Control System in which the repositories are synchronized with other team members, so there is no single central version of the codebase, but a working copy with a full change history.   It makes easy to collaborate with other people simultaneously within the same project.  Advantages of this type of system is that allow users to work independently and productively even when not connected to a network; common operations are faster because is doesn’t need to communicate with a central server; allows private work; working copies effectively function as remote backups, allows various development models to be used, permits centralized control of the latest version, and is much easier to create a team project without leadership or design conflicts. In a distributed type, every developer (team member) has their own local repository.  Everyone can push changes into a common repo.  Some of the disadvantages are: you still need a backup; there’s not really a latest version, since any of the users can easily revert a change or revert to a previous state; there are not really revision numbers. Some of the top version control systems are:  Git, Helix VCS, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, Subversion, Mercurial, Rational ClearCase, AccuRev, CVS, Kiln, and Bazaar among others.  Gib being of the most known and used DVCS.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repositories are managed by a remote server that can be on the Internet or in a network, and is shared among multiple users. In this type of repository collaborating with other team members include managing the repositories, pushing and pulling data that is shared. Remote not necessary indicates in the Internet and you can work in a “remote” repository that is in the same host. Some management skills required to work in remote repositories are: showing your remotes, adding remote repositories, fetching and pulling from your remotes, pulling to your remotes, inspecting a remote, and renaming and removing remotes.  Git is one free open source of a distributed version control system that works as a remote repository.  The local repository is the repository that resides in the local computer of the user.  There are two ways to create a local repository: a new repository or cloning an existing one. Most operations in a Version Control System are generated in the local files, but they will be “sync” to the remote repository in order to collaborate and “merge” with other team members.  The entire history of a project, resides on the local disk and most operations seem almost instantaneous.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a fast and modern implementation of Version Control System that provides a history of content changes and facilities collaborative changes to files.  Git is easy to use for any type of knowledge worker.   Git main difference among other VCS is that it thinks of its data as a series of snapshots of miniature filesystem.  Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate, so no other information or resources are required from other computer in the network.  This is because the entire history of the project are kept in the local disk, and just sync with the remote server, so working offline is possible and much work can be done, since you can commit to the local repository, and as soon as there is online connection, it can be push to the remote server.  With Git you can’t lose data or any information in transit, since Git is able to detect any file corruption by the checksum.  Every action in Git, is adding data to the Git database.  Git has three main states for the files:  Committed (stored in the database), Modified (changed but not committed) and Staged (modified and prepared to be commited).  The main sections of a Git project are: The git directory (where the metadata is stored), the working tree (a single checkout of one version of the project), and the staging area (information stored before being committed).</p>

            <p class="lead">Is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.  Is an open free source of a repository that makes easier for team members to work on projects. GitHub is one of the largest host for Git repositories.  However, to push, pull, and commit repositories from your local machine, you must have the Git software installed. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. GitHub allows developers to host their files in a repository so that other users (team members) can collaborate on projects in it, whether they are open for public contribution (open source) or closed for specific colleagues to work on a private project.  The most fundamental element of GitHub, a repository is essentially a project’s folder.  Commits are easily one of the most frequented activities by a developer using GitHub. Simply put, a commit or revision is like ‘saving’ an updated file to its original folder and overwrites an older version.  Git, together with GitHub and other similar services, is what helps drive much of the innovation that makes the internet the productive behemoth it is today.</p>
